## Project thoughts

As the Boston metropolitan area undergoes an affordable housing crisis, the state has pushed municipalities to increase their supply of affordable units. Concurrently, while Massachusetts has some of the best performing public schools in the country, there is a large difference in achievement between schools in wealthier towns and those with fewer resources. I am interested in investigating the relationship between the availability of affordable housing in a town and the quality of its public schools (as measured by MCAS scores) to see whether the cities with the greatest educational opportunities are increasing their accessibility to those who are less well off.
